    <h2>Tyler Huffaker - Who am I? </h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Tyler Huffaker, and I'm a passionate video game developer. 
      At just 20 years old, I have a beautiful wife and three amazing children. I've had a diverse journey so far, having served in the army and currently working for 
      KUB Fiber in Knoxville, Tennessee, where I specialize in fiber optic installations.
    </p>
    <h2>Reigniting My Passion for Coding</h2>
    <p>
      While my work in the army and my current job have been fulfilling, 
      I've always had a deep passion for coding and video game development. 
      Now, I'm excited to embark on a new chapter of my life, where I'm reigniting that passion by creating and designing my very first official large video game.
    </p>
    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>
      With this project, I aim to bring my unique experiences and perspectives into the world of video game development.
       My goal is to create a game that not only entertains but also tells a meaningful story, combining immersive gameplay with thought-provoking themes.
    </p>
    <h2>Join Me on this Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I invite you to join me on this exciting journey as I develop my very first official large video game.
